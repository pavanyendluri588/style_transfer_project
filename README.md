# Style Transfer Project

This project demonstrates a simple web application that performs neural style transfer using Streamlit. The application allows users to upload a content image and a style image, then applies the style of one image to the content of another. Users can adjust the strength of the style transfer via a slider.

## Features

* **Upload Images**: Upload a content image and a style image in JPG, PNG, or JPEG format.
* **Style Strength Adjustment**: Adjust the strength of the style transfer effect using a slider.
* **Real-time Image Display**: View the content image, style image, and the resulting styled image side by side.

## Getting Started
