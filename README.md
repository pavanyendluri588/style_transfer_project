# Style Transfer Project

This project demonstrates a simple web application that performs neural style transfer using Streamlit.

Users can adjust the strength of the style transfer via a slider.

## Features

- **Upload Images**: Upload a content image and a style image in JPG, PNG, or JPEG format.
- **Style Strength Adjustment**: Adjust the strength of the style transfer effect using a slider.
